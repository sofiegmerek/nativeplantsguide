  <h1> About This Site! </h1>
  <p>Hi my name is Sofie and I created this website. I've always had an interest in plants
    and this year I helped plan the redo of my house's front and back yard. We transformed 
    it from a lawn to a native and drought tolerant garden and got a $3000 rebate from the county. 
    I hope to help others learn about native plants and maybe transform their lawns as well.
