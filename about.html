    Hi my name is Sofie and I created this website. <br>
    I've always had an interest in plants and this year I helped plan the redo of my house's front and back yard. <br>
    We transformed it from a lawn to a native and drought tolerant garden and got a $3000 rebate from the county.  <br>
    I hope to help others learn about native plants and maybe transform their lawns as well. <br>
    Here are some photos of my process:  <br>
