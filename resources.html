  <h1>Helpful Resources</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some helpful resources to help you with your garden and native plant journey.
    <div>
    <h3>Calscape</h3>
    <a href = "https://calscape.org/">Calscape</a> has been very useful for me in my garden journey, and is a fantastic resource for learning
    about and finding native plants. Calscape has many resources on different native plants to California, and each plant
    has information about what soil it likes, the sun it likes, and where to find it. Calscape is also great to get pictures
    from, to see the plants and to refine your search, with advanced search you can find plants that are in certain
    nurseries or have certain climates and needs. This website is fantastic for detailed information and to delve deep into
    native plants. Using the search feature can also help you find more information about plants you 
    are looking at, but make sure your spelling is correct! </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Calscape Garden Planner</h3>
    <a href= "https://gardenplanner.calscape.org/">Calscape Garden Planner</a> is another fantastic website, also
    made by calscape. This is a more simple way to plan a garden, you answer the questions, such as about what kind of sun you have, 
    or what attributes you want the plants to have, such as deer resistant or butterly friendly, and it will return ideas. 
    The website is great for begining to get an idea for your garden, it can give you a list of plants, and a list of blueprints 
    for sample garden and where to put the plants. It's a great resource if you're looking for inspiration and is very beginner friendly.</div>
    <div>
    <h3>California Native Plant Society</h3>
    <a href ="https://www.cnps.org/gardening">California Native Plant Society</a> is a great website for learning
    about California native plants. It has many resources on plants, garden innspiration, and preparing for a garden. This website
    has many links to articles and pages for what you may be interested in and gives great information. They also have virtual garden tours
    where you can walk through a native plant garden! You can get inspiration from these tours and experience what a native plant garden can look like.
     You can also learn from garden ambassadors and see their native gardens and stories. Learning from people can be helpful as they too have gone through challenges, and 
    can share their wisdom with you and provide different opinions.  </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Master Gardeners</h3>
    <a href = "https://www.mastergardenersd.org">Master Gardeners of the County</a> is another great resource for gardening information. 
    There are master gardeners for many different counties in California so be sure to check out the oens for your county. Master Gardeners provide
    lots of good information on growing plants, gardening, and typically hold training or workshop events. They are a great resource to learn about gardens
    in your community and to find community events and workshops to start learning hands on! One of my family friends is a master gardener and we always go to her 
    for advice on plants and gardening. There also are master gardener gardens, which you can visit and see native plants in action!

    <h3>California Native Plant Library</h3>
    <a href = "https://theodorepayne.org/nativeplantdatabase/index.php?title=Main_Page">California Native Plant Library</a> is another great resource for native plant information. 
    This site is formatted like a wiki and has simple navigation to find native plants by letter, 
    by plant type, by flower color, or by water needs. It is a very simple and easy to use website made by the Theodore Payne foundation. 
    The Theodore Payne foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to California native plants!
    Another nice feature is their garden guides, where they have planting guides for native plants for all the different seasons. They give advice on when to plant, 
    how to plant, how to water, annd how to prune in an easy general guide.

    <h3>Theodore Payne Foundation</h3>
    <a href = "https://theodorepayne.org/">Theodore Payne Foundation</a> is another great resource for native plant information. 
    This site has a lot more options and features than their native plant wiki. It has information on growing plants,
    where to buy them, and how to visit their nursery. There are also many events and workshops 
    you can learn from and register for at this site. They also have an online store where you can buy
    native seeds and gardening supplies to be shipped to you! I also think this foundation and website have
    a great mission in normalizing and encouraging more native plant gardens!

    <h3>UCSC Arboretum</h3>
    <a href = "https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/index.html">The UCSC Arboretum</a> is another resource for gardening information, 
    located on the UC Santa Cruz campus it is a great place to go and see a diversity of plant life. They have various sections
    of gardens for different areas such as California, Australia, New Zealand, and more. They have good information and 
    galleries of the native plants you can see and explore. They also are very knnowledgeable in plants and gardening and are easy to contact by email.
    They also support conservation and education about native plants and it is a great resource for help in gardening. It is also a 
    fantastic place to visit if you're near Santa Cruz!
