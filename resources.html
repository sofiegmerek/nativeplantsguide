  <h1>Helpful Resources</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some helpful resources to help you with your garden and native plant journey.
      
    <h3>Calscape</h3>
    <a href = "https://calscape.org/">Calscape</a> has been very useful for me in my garden journey, and is a fantastic resource for learning
    about and finding native plants. Calscape has many resources on different native plants to California, and each plant
    has information about what soil it likes, the sun it likes, and where to find it. Calscape is also great to get pictures
    from, to see the plants and to refine your search, with advanced search you can find plants that are in certain
    nurseries or have certain climates and needs.
    <h3>Calscape Garden Planner</h3>
    <a href= "https://gardenplanner.calscape.org/">Calscape Garden Planner</a> is another fantastic website, also
    made by calscape. This is a more simple way to plan a garden, you answer the questions, such as about what kind of sun you have, 
    or what attributes you want the plants to have, such as deer resistant or butterly friendly, and it will return ideas. 
    The website is great for begining to get an idea for your garden, it can give you a list of plants, and a list of blueprints 
    for sample garden and where to put the plants. It's a great resource if you're looking for inspiration and is very beginner friendly.
    <h3>California Native Plant Society</h3>
    <a href ="https://www.cnps.org/gardening">California Native Plant Society</a> is a great website for learning
    about California native plants. It has many resources on plants, garden innspiration, and preparing for a garden. This website
    has many links to articles and pages for what you may be interested in and gives great information. They also have virtual garden tours
    where you can walk through a native plant garden! You can also learn from garden ambassadors and see their native gardens and stories. 
    <h3>Master Gardeners</h3>
    <a href = "https://www.mastergardenersd.org">Master Gardeners of the County</a> is another great resource for gardening information. 
    There are master gardeners for many different counties in California so be sure to check out the oens for your county. Master Gardeners provide
    lots of good information on growing plants, gardening, and typically hold training or workshop events. They are a great resource to learn about gardens
    in your community and to find community events and workshops to start learning hands on!
